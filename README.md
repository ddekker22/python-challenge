Module 3 Assignment: PyBank and PyPoll

PyBank analyzes monthly finances for a company. PyPoll analyzes election data. 
The repository contains the following folders for each dataset:  
    - A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.  
    - A Resources folder that contains the CSV files used.  
    - An analysis folder that contains a text file that has the results from each analysis.  

I used information from Stack overflow for help with pushing the results to a text file, including append vs write. I ran through a few ideas on how to design this code, including pushing the original csv information into a list of dictionaries, but I found creating new lists for each column made the calculations and logic simpler for the first dataset. 
Using a dictionary worked for the PyPoll dataset.
