Module 3 Assignment: PyBank and PyPoll

PyBank analyzes monthly finances for a company. PyPoll analyzes election data. 
The repository contains the following folders for each dataset: \n
  A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis. \n
  A Resources folder that contains the CSV files used. \n
  An analysis folder that contains a text file that has the results from each analysis. \n

I used information from Stack overflow for help with pushing the results to a text file. I ran through a few ideas on how to design this code, including pushing the original csv information into a list of dictionaries, but I found creating new lists for each column made the calculations and logic simpler for this dataset.
